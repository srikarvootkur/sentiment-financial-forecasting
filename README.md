# Sentiment Financial Forecasting

**Sentiment Financial Forecasting** is a machine learning project designed to predict financial market trends by integrating quantitative financial data with qualitative sentiment analysis. This project leverages the **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** to provide interpretable multi-horizon forecasting, enabling analysts and investors to gain deeper insights into market dynamics and sentiment impact.

## Overview

### Objective
The aim is to combine **financial indicators** (e.g., stock prices, trading volumes) with **sentiment analysis** derived from social media, news, and other textual data to improve the accuracy and interpretability of financial market predictions.

### Key Features
- **Data Integration:** Combines financial and sentiment data streams.
- **Advanced Modeling:** Uses Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) for robust and interpretable time-series forecasting.
- **Explainable Predictions:** Highlights the most impactful features driving model outputs.
- **Scalable Workflow:** Modular pipeline for easy extension and adaptation.

### Steps:
1. **Data Collection:**
   - **Financial Data:** Retrieved from APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
   - **Sentiment Data:** Collected from sources such as Twitter, StockTwits, or financial news APIs.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and normalize financial and sentiment data.
   - Merge data streams using timestamps to align them for modeling.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Generate time-based features (e.g., moving averages, volatility indicators).
   - Compute sentiment scores using NLP techniques like VADER or transformer-based models.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Train the **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** on the preprocessed dataset.
   - Optimize hyperparameters for forecasting accuracy and interpretability.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Validate the model using metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
   - Analyze feature importance using TFT’s built-in attention mechanisms.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the model via an API for real-time or batch predictions.
   - Integrate predictions into existing financial dashboards or tools.
